### Introduction
The project our team is working on is an interactive web page based on the recent Corona Virus outbreak, where users can learn about changes in air quality, human flow and so on before and after the outbreak,so that they are able to schedule their travel plans during the outbreak. During this gradually relieving-period, the covering capabilities of different regions vary from each other. So we used data on the number of people diagnosed in different areas to simulate the virus content(numbers) and realize part of data visualization to remind users keep far away from areas where they are still at risk. Although our project was a little different from our original plan, but we did want to make our project as rich and comprehensive as possible, giving users access to more data, details and information.
