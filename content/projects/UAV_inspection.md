## Introduction
Traditional wild animal inspection system uses jeeps driving around the protection zone, which costs huge amounts of human resoureces and money. To optimize the wild animal inspection efficency and lower the cost of the procdure, we came up with a mthod which combines UAV and LoRa, which is a kind of long range communication device. We use drones to replace the jeeps and design the flying trail to cover the protection area. This project got a national second prize in China 3S Cup LoT Contest.
