## Intro

Electromyogram (EMG) signal is very popular in hand gesture analysis, prostheses control technologies. The EMG signal is generated by the human muscles and can be collected using censors, different movements of our muscles can result in different features of EMG signal, like frequency and amplitude. However, the classification of EMG signal is not an easy job due to mainly two reasons. Firstly, the noisy behaviors of EMG signal can influence the recognize process. Secondly, the small number of gestures per person relative to the number of generated data by each gesture. In this project, different kinds of pattern recognition methods will be used to compare the classification accuracy, and find the best way to increase the EMG signal recognition efficiency. The algorithms including convolution neural network(CNNs),fuzzy logic classifier, K-means clustering, K-nearest neighbour
