## Introduction
The electromagnetic wave can spread by reflecting from ionosphere and ocean, but the attenuation during this process limited the communication effect. In this paper, we discussed the situation that the electromagnetic wave propagation on the ocean. \
Based on the Fresnel law and the calculation formula of transmission loss for shortwave skywave communication, we set up a model to discuss the calculation of the attenuation of calm ocean surface and the signal strength after a hopping. Then, based on the literature, the ocean surface is modeled as a Gaussian random process that conforms to the PL ocean spectrum to simulate the dynamic ocean surface. The time-varying characteristics of the ocean surface are obtained by the diffusion relation of the gravity waves. Through this model we calculated the attenuation of the turbulent ocean surface and the corresponding Signal strength after a jump. Then, according to the formula of SNR ratio, we increased the number of jumps until max (SNR) <10db, and got the maximum number of hops that satisfy the problem.\
For part2, we established a mirror reflection attenuation model for smooth terrain area, which consider the smooth terrain as an ideal plane. The reflection attenuation off the smooth ground generates for the interference effect. We solved the attenuation by using mirror method. When it comes to the condition that electromagnetic waves reflect off the rugged terrain, we simplified the rugged terrain as a regular rough plane which exists diffuse reflection. By using the reflectivity off rough plane formula, we obtained the electromagnetic wave reflect attenuation off rugged terrain. By comparison, we found the reflect attenuation off the rugged terrain is smaller than that off the smooth terrain. And the reflect attenuation off the land is larger than that off ocean.\
In part3, a boat which has a receiver on it moves with the waves on the turbulent ocean. The attenuation of receiver exists for the position of antenna always changes. We considered the ship as a mass point which does simple harmonic motion with the wave. Then we establish an empirical equation of receive attenuation, the attenuation changes when the root mean square height of ocean and the distance between receiver and transmitter changes. Adding the attenuation into calculation, we solved the maximum time that the ship can communicate normally ,that is 4.5h.
