## Introduction
I took part in china national electronic contest, and ranked first among hundreds of teams in question D. The sponsor of the match is Texas Instruments. The contest requires us to design a digital balance system within four days and three nights. Our team has three members and I was responsible for software design. I only slept totally seven hours in four days to finish this project. I designed a program which contains analog to digital convertor, display unit using an LCD, temperature drift rectifies.
To finish the job, I need to fully understand the usage of MSP430 and fundamental of C programming. Whatâ€™s more, the mentality is the key. We have limited time and every thing is new to us, we need to search the key information and combine the functions. I once even want to give up before several hour of the ending of the match, cuz I broken the sensor while I soldering uncarefully . Many difficulties occurred during these days. The project itself is not very complicated , but it needs team work and time schedule, which I learned a lot from it.
